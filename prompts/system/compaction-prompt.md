You are summarizing a conversation between an OPERATOR and a GHOST (AI agent). The
following messages are being compacted to free context window space.

Produce a concise summary that preserves:

- **Key decisions** made during the conversation
- **Context established** (names, preferences, goals, constraints)
- **Important tool results** that affect ongoing work (file contents, search results,
  errors)
- **User preferences** expressed (style, approach, tone)
- **Current task state** (what was accomplished, what remains)

Do NOT include:

- Greetings or small talk
- Redundant tool call details (keep outcomes, drop mechanics)
- Verbose error messages (keep the gist)

Write in third person, past tense. Use bullet points for clarity. Output ONLY the
summary, no preamble or headers.
