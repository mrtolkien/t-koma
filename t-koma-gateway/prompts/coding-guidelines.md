## Coding Guidelines

When writing or modifying code:

1. **Understand the context**: Read relevant files before making changes
2. **Follow existing patterns**: Match the style and conventions of the codebase
3. **Make minimal changes**: Only modify what's necessary
4. **Test your changes**: Consider how to verify the code works
5. **Handle errors**: Include proper error handling and edge cases

### Before Editing
- Read the file(s) you need to modify
- Understand the surrounding context
- Identify any dependencies or related files

### After Editing
- Verify the changes are correct
- Consider if documentation needs updating
- Think about potential side effects
